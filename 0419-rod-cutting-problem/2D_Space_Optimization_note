Key Concepts:
prev: This array stores the results of the previous row in the DP table, which corresponds to the computations for the previous ind 
(the previous rod length option).
curr: This array is used to compute the values for the current row in the DP table, corresponding to the current ind.
Why use curr?:
The take case involves cutting the rod into smaller lengths (specifically, of size rodLength = ind + 1).
When you decide to "take" a piece of rod of length rodLength, the problem size reduces, and you then consider the remaining portion of 
the rod (N - rodLength).
curr[N - rodLength] means that for the current rod length (ind), you are considering the optimal solution for the remaining length 
(N - rodLength), based on the choices you are making in this current iteration (i.e., the current value of ind).
Using prev here would be incorrect because you would be using the result from the previous rod length (ind - 1), 
which is not what you want. You want to use the current rod length to calculate the optimal solution for the remaining length.
