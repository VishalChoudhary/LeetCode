Your Task:</br>
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function kthLargest() which takes the root of the BST and an integer K as inputs and returns the Kth largest element in the given BST.</br>

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).</br>
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(H) where H is max recursion stack of height H at a given time.</br>

Constraints:</br>
1 <= N <= 10⁵</br>
1 <= K <= N</br>
