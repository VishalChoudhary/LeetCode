Given an integer n representing the number of vertices. Find out how many undirected graphs (not necessarily connected) can be constructed out of a given n number of vertices. </br>

Example 1:
Input: 2 </br> Output: 2 </br>

Example 2:
Input: 5 </br> Output: 1024 </br>

Your Task:
Complete the function count() which takes an integer n as input and returns the count of total number of graphs possible. </br>
